# Titanic Survival Prediction — CodSoft Internship

## 🚀 Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. It was built as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship (Batch B71).

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- Target: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning (handle missing Age and Embarked)
2. Feature Engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone, Title)
3. Encoding (Sex, Embarked)
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 📈 Results
- Best Model: Random Forest
- Accuracy: 82.5%
- Key Features: Sex, Pclass, Fare, Title
